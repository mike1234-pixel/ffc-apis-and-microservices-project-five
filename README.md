## User stories:

1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.
2. The form file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response

## Usage :

- Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.

## Packages

This API is written in _Node.js_ with the help of _express_ and _multer_.
